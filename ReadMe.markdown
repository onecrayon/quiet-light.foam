Quiet Light is an Espresso theme using a light background and color scheme.
To install, save the file Quiet Light.css into your `~/Library/Application
Support/Espresso/Themes` folder and relaunch Espresso. It will then be 
available in the Preferences.

I created Quiet Light because I wasn't happy with Espresso's default theme or
with any of the numerous dark themes available.  Enjoy!
